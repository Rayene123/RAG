What is the risk status of clients with overdue payments?,"Based on the provided client information, **none of the clients (Client IDs: 254132, 170560, 312732) have overdue payments**.

Key details:
- **Current Overdue Days**: 0 for all clients.
- **Current Overdue Amount**: $0 for all clients.
- **Risk Status**: All are labeled **""DEFAULT RISK""** due to factors like high debt-to-income ratios or lack of credit history, **not** because of overdue payments.
- **Payment Behavior**: All show **0.0% payment completion ratio** and **0.0 days average delay**, indicating no missed payments.

Thus, **clients with overdue payments do not exist in this dataset**. The default risk stems from other financial vulnerabilities (e.g., high outstanding debt relative to income).","['Client ID: 254132\nDocument Type: Client Financial Profile\nProfile Generated On: 2025-01-03\nData Coverage Period: 2015–2024\n\nPersonal Information:\n- Age: 67 years\n- Gender: M\n- Education Level: Secondary / secondary special\n- Family Status: Single / not married\n- Number of Children: 0\n- Household Size: 1\n- Housing Type: House / apartment\n\nAssets & Ownership:\n- Owns Real Estate: No\n- Owns a Car: Yes (age: 10 years)\n\nEmployment & Income:\n- Income Type: Pensioner\n- Occupation: Unknown\n- Years Employed: Unknown\n- Annual Income: $112,500\n\nCurrent Loan Application:\n- Contract Type: Cash loans\n- Requested Credit Amount: $514,778\n- Monthly Annuity: $26,280\n- Goods Price: $477,000\n\nPrevious Loan Applications:\n- No previous loan history recorded\n\nCredit History & Payment Behavior:\n- Active External Credits: 1\n- Total External Credit Amount: $450,000\n- Total Outstanding Debt: $141,426\n- Average Payment Delay: 0.0 days\n- Payment Completion Ratio: 0.0%\n- Current Overdue Days: 0\n- Historical Maximum Overdue Days: 0\n- Total Credit Prolongations: 0\n- Current Overdue Amount: $0\n- Historical Maximum Overdue Amount: $0\n\nRisk Assessment:\nStatus: DEFAULT RISK\nReasoning:\n- No current overdue payments\n- Early or on-time payment pattern', 'Client ID: 170560\nDocument Type: Client Financial Profile\nProfile Generated On: 2025-01-03\nData Coverage Period: 2015–2024\n\nPersonal Information:\n- Age: 65 years\n- Gender: F\n- Education Level: Secondary / secondary special\n- Family Status: Married\n- Number of Children: 0\n- Household Size: 2\n- Housing Type: House / apartment\n\nAssets & Ownership:\n- Owns Real Estate: No\n- Owns a Car: Yes (age: 18 years)\n\nEmployment & Income:\n- Income Type: Pensioner\n- Occupation: Unknown\n- Years Employed: Unknown\n- Annual Income: $76,500\n\nCurrent Loan Application:\n- Contract Type: Cash loans\n- Requested Credit Amount: $427,500\n- Monthly Annuity: $13,090\n- Goods Price: $427,500\n\nPrevious Loan Applications:\n- No previous loan history recorded\n\nCredit History & Payment Behavior:\n- Active External Credits: 3\n- Total External Credit Amount: $1,348,851\n- Total Outstanding Debt: $528,226\n- Average Payment Delay: 0.0 days\n- Payment Completion Ratio: 0.0%\n- Current Overdue Days: 0\n- Historical Maximum Overdue Days: 0\n- Total Credit Prolongations: 0\n- Current Overdue Amount: $0\n- Historical Maximum Overdue Amount: $0\n\nRisk Assessment:\nStatus: DEFAULT RISK\nReasoning:\n- No current overdue payments\n- Early or on-time payment pattern', 'Client ID: 312732\nDocument Type: Client Financial Profile\nProfile Generated On: 2025-01-03\nData Coverage Period: 2015–2024\n\nPersonal Information:\n- Age: 65 years\n- Gender: F\n- Education Level: Secondary / secondary special\n- Family Status: Widow\n- Number of Children: 0\n- Household Size: 1\n- Housing Type: House / apartment\n\nAssets & Ownership:\n- Owns Real Estate: Yes\n- Owns a Car: No\n\nEmployment & Income:\n- Income Type: Pensioner\n- Occupation: Unknown\n- Years Employed: Unknown\n- Annual Income: $157,500\n\nCurrent Loan Application:\n- Contract Type: Cash loans\n- Requested Credit Amount: $127,350\n- Monthly Annuity: $7,438\n- Goods Price: $112,500\n\nPrevious Loan Applications:\n- No previous loan history recorded\n\nCredit History & Payment Behavior:\n- Active External Credits: 4\n- Total External Credit Amount: $848,662\n- Total Outstanding Debt: $512,050\n- Average Payment Delay: 0.0 days\n- Payment Completion Ratio: 0.0%\n- Current Overdue Days: 0\n- Historical Maximum Overdue Days: 0\n- Total Credit Prolongations: 0\n- Current Overdue Amount: $0\n- Historical Maximum Overdue Amount: $0\n\nRisk Assessment:\nStatus: DEFAULT RISK\nReasoning:\n- No current overdue payments\n- Early or on-time payment pattern']"
